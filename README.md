# Sahithi Website

This is a React portfolio app. 

Mobile responsiveness

- The app is fully responsive across phones, tablets, and desktops. Navigation becomes a hamburger menu on small screens.
- Typography is fluid using CSS clamp() so headings and paragraphs scale by viewport.
- The Work timeline stacks vertically under 768px; the central line is hidden for clarity.
- You can tweak breakpoints and sizes in `src/index.css` and `src/components/NavBar/index.css`.

Getting started

1. Install client dependencies (from project root):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Run the app

- Start the React client (from project root):

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
