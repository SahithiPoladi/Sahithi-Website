# Sahithi Website

This is a React portfolio app. I added a small Express + MongoDB backend in the `server/` folder to make this a full-stack application.

Getting started

1. Install client dependencies (from project root):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install server dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

Run the app

- Start the React client (from project root):

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- Start the server (from project root):

  ```bash
  npm run start:server
  ```

Or run both in development (client with CRA and server with nodemon). The `dev` script uses `npm-run-all`; if not installed, run the two commands in separate terminals:

  ```bash
  # terminal 1
  npm start

  # terminal 2
  cd server && npm run dev
  ```

Seeding the DB (local MongoDB required)

From the `server/` folder run:

```bash
npm run config
```

Configuration

Create a `.env` file inside `server/` (or set env vars) with:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/sahithi_portfolio
PORT=5000
```

API endpoints

- GET /api/items
- GET /api/items/:id
- POST /api/items
- PUT /api/items/:id
- DELETE /api/items/:id

From the client you can fetch `/api/items` (when developing, the client runs on 3000 and server on 5000). Consider adding a `proxy` field to the root `package.json` or use absolute URLs when deploying.

If you'd like, I can add example client code to call these APIs and show items in the React UI.
1. Clone the project and run `npm install` on the project.
2. Once the node_modules are created please run `npm start` and the application will start in a local server

Docker Compose (production)

You can run the app and a MongoDB instance together using Docker Compose. Steps:

1. Copy the example env file and edit values as needed:

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  # edit .env to set CLIENT_ORIGIN and SCHEDULER_ENABLED as required
  ```

2. Start in detached mode (builds image using the repository `Dockerfile`):

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --build
  ```

3. Check logs or view containers:

  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  docker-compose logs -f web
  ```

Notes:
- The server will be available on port 5000 by default (map: host:5000 -> container:5000).
- The compose file defines a `mongo` service; by default the server connects to `mongodb://mongo:27017` when using the provided `.env`.
- For production deployments behind a reverse proxy, set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` to your frontend domain and configure TLS at the proxy layer.
